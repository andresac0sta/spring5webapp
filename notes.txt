--configuring controllers associates a controller method with
    a request path.
--When spring get a request on a specific path a specific controller method
    will be called.

--Is good practice adding a package for controllers.
--Use Controller as a naming convention e.g BookController.

To configure a controller in spring:
--Use the @Controller annotation.
    This will register the class as a spring bean and as a controller in
    spring MVC.

    @Controller
    public class BookController {}

To set up the http request path
--use @RequestMapping annotation
    this will tell spring to associate a path with a controller method.

           @RequestMapping("/books")
            public String getBooks(Model model){

                model.addAttribute("books", bookRepository.findAll());

                return "books";
            }
    **notice the /books path  @RequestMapping("/books")
    **notice the (Model model) parameter which is the model part of the MVC
    **Keep in mind the model is what is going to be return to the view layer behind the scenes so the
        view layer is going to get a copy of the model.
    **notice we are returning the view "books"

--Now add a field  BookRepository created using the repository pattern which handles
    the service layer getting stuff from the database.
--Add a constructor to the class and inject a BookRepository.
--Basically we are asking spring to inject a BookRepository

     private final BookRepository bookRepository;

     public BookController(BookRepository bookRepository) {
            this.bookRepository = bookRepository;
     }
--Now that we have a constructor and this is a controller when spring instantiates this it will inject an instance of that
    book repository into our controller.

--Now add the attribute to our model
    model.addAttribute("books", bookRepository.findAll());

--"books" is the attribute name and bookRepository.findAll() is the attribute value.

--The method returns a list of books in the model for the view layer.
