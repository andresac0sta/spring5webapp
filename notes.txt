--Here we created a class to run the application BootStrapData.java
--we annotated with @Component to tell spring framework that this is a spring managed component.
    which implements CommandLineRunner.
--CommandLineRunner  is used to run a code block only once in application’s lifetime – after application is initialized.
--you can use CommandLineRunner in 3 ways
    Using CommandLineRunner as @Component.
    Implement CommandLineRunner in @SpringBootApplication.
    Using CommandLineRunner as Bean.
-- see https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-boot/command-line-runner-interface-example/ for more details

Our case:
    @Component
    public class BootStrapData implements CommandLineRunner {}

Next we are doing constructor dependency injection by declaring the properties of the repository interfaces

    private final AuthorRepository authorRepository;
    private final BookRepository bookRepository;

    public BootStrapData(AuthorRepository authorRepository, BookRepository bookRepository) {
        this.authorRepository = authorRepository;
        this.bookRepository = bookRepository;
    }
