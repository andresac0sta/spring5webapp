spring data repositories

--spring data is a family of projects but we are going to look into
--spring data JPA which is made to work with Hibernate.
--spring data implements the repository pattern instead of the
    data access objects (DAO)
--With the repository pattern the repository object is responsible
    for your persistence and query  operation.

--spring data JPA is taking care of all the hibernate commands, all the transactional
    commands.

To implement the repository pattern
--create a new directory called repositories
--add an interface e.g. AuthorRepository that extends CrudRepository
    public interface AuthorRepository extends CrudRepository<Author, Long> {}
--where CrudRepository<Author, Long> Author is the class and Long for the id
    property which is a Long
--The CrudRepository will grant us access to all CRUD operations count(),findAll().
