JPA does require a zero argument constructor as
To make a POJO into a  JPA entity
-annotate the class with @Entity
-annotate the field id with
     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
 the  GenerationType.AUTO means the database is going to take care of generating the ids.

 Now set up relationships in this case is a many-to-many relation between authors and books
 In the Author.java clas use
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors")
  private Set<Book> books;

Now do a joined table in the Book.java class
  @ManyToMany
  @JoinTable(name = "author_book", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id"),
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id"))
  private Set<Author> authors;
